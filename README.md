1. Run main.m file in the MATLAB.
2. Click m(in parameters.m file) waypoints int the left top axis, which will assign x and y values of the waypoints.
3. Click m altitudes of the waypoints you chose in the previous step.
4. QP program will run automatically according to the parameters in the 'parameters.m' file.
5. Plots of the result show two result where the black one is the result without corridor constraints while red one is with them.
